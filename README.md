# Typing Game
> No releases yet, will add some as soon as I can.
This is a simple Typing Game I made for Windows with WPF & C#
Automatically starts a timer when the first input is detected, displays CPM(characters per minute) at the end of the test.

### Keybinds
|Key|Action|
|-|-|
|Tab|End Current Test, Results are no longer accurate.|
|Ctrl +|Increase Font Size|
|Ctrl -|Decrease Font Size|

### Text
You can use custom Texts for you tests by changing the quotes.txt file:
- Each Text has to be on one line, it will be formatted automatically.
- author.txt must be changed on the same line to stay accurate.
- If the text is too long, it will no longer fit into the window unless you change the window size and/or the font size.
